The OSU Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) is a nonprofit organization working for the
advancement of open source technologies.  The lab, in partnership with the
School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State
University, provides hosting for more than 160 projects, including those of
worldwide leaders like the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation and
Drupal. Together, the OSLâ€™s hosted sites deliver nearly 430 terabytes of
information to people around the world every month. The most active organization
of its kind, the OSL offers world-class hosting services, professional software
development and on-the-ground training for promising students interested in open
source management and programming. The Open Source Lab is now part of a big
experiential learning center at Oregon State called the `Center for Applied
Systems and Software`_ (CASS). CASS provides students hands-on experience in
testing, software development, networking, devops, and hosting.
