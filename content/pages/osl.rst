The Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) is a nonprofit
organization advancing open source technologies.  The OSL hosts more than 160
projects including global technology leaders like the Apache Software
Foundation, the Linux Foundation and Drupal.  Combined, the OSLâ€™s hosted sites
deliver nearly 430 terabytes of information worldwide every month.  The most
active organization of its kind, the OSL offers world-class hosting services,
professional software development, and on-the-ground training for promising
students interested in open source management and programming.

The Open Source Lab is now part of an experiential learning center at Oregon
State called the `Center for Applied Systems and Software`_ (CASS).  CASS
provides students hands-on experience in testing, software development,
networking, devops, and hosting.  DevOps Bootcamp and DevOps Daycamp are both
part of this broader effort to educate passionate students at OSU and beyond.
