Topics covered

We are still working out specific topics for this year's fall kickoff however we are planning on discussing at least
the following:

Introductory Workshop and Navigating Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Review what DevOps and DevOps Bootcamp are.
- Cover what DevOps BootCamp will teach you throughout the year.
- Get you started with your own Linux server that that you can use for hands on demos.
- Get started using that Remote Linux Virtual Machine (VM)!

All you need to do is have a laptop and web browser.

Operating Systems, Users, and Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- What an operating system is.
- Who (and what) a Linux User can be.
- What a file is in Linux and how to learn about them.

Software, Documentation, and Getting on IRC & Slack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- What software is.
- How to install software in Linux.
- How to find documentation for a project.
- How you communicate with open source projects.

And finally we will get you on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and Slack so you can communicate with DevOps Bootcamp teachers
and students throughout the year.

Industry Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network with OSL and CASS professionals and alumni currently working in the tech industry. This free-from discussion
can answer any questions you have about doing DevOps as a career. In the past, we have had professionals from Mozilla,
Linux Foundation, and Apache Software Foundation. This year's panel will be announced in the weeks leading up to the
event.
