Ansible
-------
*Tanner Semerad*

The Ansible project describes itself as “a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy.” Ansible is a YAML-based configuration management language and it uses ssh to communicate with servers, rather than an agent.

Travis CI
---------
*Michael Cooper*

Travis CI is a continuous integration system that runs tests in order to ensure the compatibility of a code within a project. Travis CI is unique in its ability to be added to a repository on Github, which allows tests to be run on commits, which allows the user to see whether or not a pull request is safe to merge.

Docker 
------
*Daniel Takamori*

Docker is a platform on which applications can be built and run using containers. Applications built on Docker are isolated from the rest of the system. The containers have only the components required to run the application.
