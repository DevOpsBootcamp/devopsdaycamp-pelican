DevOps DayCamp is a follow-up event to DevOps BootCamp Fall Kickoff. The hands-on workshop is designed 
to teach participants DevOps, a program development process that includes building, testing, and releasing software. 

If you didn't attend BootCamp in the Fall, it will be helpful if you become familiar with the content that was 
covered there (found in the DevOps website)
