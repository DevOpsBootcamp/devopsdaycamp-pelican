Ansible

The Ansible project describes itself as “a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy.” Ansible is a YAML-based configuration management language and it uses ssh to communicate with servers, rather than an agent.

Travis CI is a continuous integration system that runs tests in order to ensure the compatibility of a code within a project. Travis CI is unique in its ability to be added to a repository on Github, which allows tests to be run on commits, which allows the user to see whether or not a pull request is safe to merge.

Docker 
------
*Daniel Takamori*

*4:00 - 6:00*

Docker is a platform on which applications can be built and run using containers. Applications built on Docker are isolated from the rest of the system; the containers have only the components required to run the application.
