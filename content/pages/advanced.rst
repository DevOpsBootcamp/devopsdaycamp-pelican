`Packer`_
---------
*9:00 - 9:30*

**Lance Albertson**

If youâ€™re managing your own infrastructure, you always want to have 
a reliable and simple way create and maintain server deployment 
images. Packer is tool for creating virtual machine images in an 
identical way easily. It can be used to create images for a variety 
of cloud and virtualization platforms. This session will cover the 
basics of how you can make an image using Packer. In addition it 
will cover some more advanced topics with Packer.

`Software's Source of Truth: Configuration`_
--------------------------------------------
*9:30 - 10:00*

**K Lars Lohn**

Configuration is the authority of truth for a program. 
Configuration is constant.  Configuration is required.  
Expressed in various languages, configuration imbues a program 
with insight into its environment, operating parameters, maybe 
even its ultimate goal.  Configuration is actually deceptively 
difficult.

`Testing Infrastructure`_
-------------------------
*10:00 - 10:30*

**Spencer Krum**

With infrastructure defined as code, we can use the best practices 
that developers have been using for years. We can test our 
changes before they go to production. That's the idea anyway. 
In this talk I'll give a history of this idea and describe the 
things people are doing in this space. I'll describe what I do 
at my work, and the engineering trade-offs that you must consider 
when designing or implementing a system to test your infrastructure 
changes before they go live.

A short history of web scale MySQL
----------------------------------
*10:30 - 11:00*

**Mark Callaghan**

For the last 10 years I have helped make MySQL better for web 
scale deployments at Facebook and Google. While I am a developer 
I spent a lot of time in production and this was a wonderful 
education. I will describe some of the problems we solved and 
others that we tried but failed to fix. Finally, I will explain 
the features that we need from open-source databases in the future.

GPG in the Real World
---------------------
*11:00 - 12:00*

**Emily Dunham**

On a distributed DevOps team, securely communicating secret 
information is essential. GPG keys have two primary uses: 
Signing files to verify the identity of the person or machine 
who created them, and encrypting communication so that files 
can only be decrypted by their intended recipient. Although it 
sounds simple, GPG's implementations are notorious for being 
difficult to use and understand. This talk will refresh your 
memory about GPG without delving too deeply into the underlying 
mathematics, then focus mainly on common practical applications 
beyond the scope of your average key-signing party.

*12:00 - 1:00*

All Your Base Are Belong To Us
------------------------------
*1:00 - 2:00*

**Daniel Takamori**

If you ever wanted more reasons to be paranoid about your 
computer, here's a talk that will surely do that!  30 minutes 
on common attacks; covering a bit of implementing crypto, 
how to not get social engineered, and dealing with zero days.  
Then a 30 minute demo on some neat attacks and a sandbox to test against.

APIs and Thinking Like a Unix
-----------------------------
*2:00 - 2:30*

**Kenneth Lett**
